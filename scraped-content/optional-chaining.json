      "level": 2,
      "content": "You specify optional chaining by placing a question mark (?) after the optional value on which you wish to call a property, method or subscript if the optional is non-nil. This is very similar to placing an exclamation point (!) after an optional value to force the unwrapping of its value. The main difference is that optional chaining fails gracefully when the optional is nil, whereas forced unwrapping triggers a runtime error when the optional is nil.\n\nTo reflect the fact that optional chaining can be called on a nil value, the result of an optional chaining call is always an optional value, even if the property, method, or subscript you are querying returns a non-optional value. You can use this optional return value to check whether the optional chaining call was successful (the returned optional contains a value), or didn’t succeed due to a nil value in the chain (the returned optional value is nil).\n\nSpecifically, the result of an optional chaining call is of the same type as the expected return value, but wrapped in an optional. A property that normally returns an Int will return an Int? when accessed through optional chaining.\n\nThe next several code snippets demonstrate how optional chaining differs from forced unwrapping and enables you to check for success.\n\nFirst, two classes called Person and Residence are defined:\n\nResidence instances have a single Int property called numberOfRooms, with a default value of 1. Person instances have an optional residence property of type Residence?.\n\nIf you create a new Person instance, its residence property is default initialized to nil, by virtue of being optional. In the code below, john has a residence property value of nil:\n\nIf you try to access the numberOfRooms property of this person’s residence, by placing an exclamation point after residence to force the unwrapping of its value, you trigger a runtime error, because there’s no residence value to unwrap:\n\nThe code above succeeds when john.residence has a non-nil value and will set roomCount to an Int value containing the appropriate number of rooms. However, this code always triggers a runtime error when residence is nil, as illustrated above.\n\nOptional chaining provides an alternative way to access the value of numberOfRooms. To use optional chaining, use a question mark in place of the exclamation point:\n\nThis tells Swift to “chain” on the optional residence property and to retrieve the value of numberOfRooms if residence exists.\n\nBecause the attempt to access numberOfRooms has the potential to fail, the optional chaining attempt returns a value of type Int?, or “optional Int”. When residence is nil, as in the example above, this optional Int will also be nil, to reflect the fact that it was not possible to access numberOfRooms. The optional Int is accessed through optional binding to unwrap the integer and assign the non-optional value to the roomCount constant.\n\nNote that this is true even though numberOfRooms is a non-optional Int. The fact that it’s queried through an optional chain means that the call to numberOfRooms will always return an Int? instead of an Int.\n\nYou can assign a Residence instance to john.residence, so that it no longer has a nil value:\n\njohn.residence now contains an actual Residence instance, rather than nil. If you try to access numberOfRooms with the same optional chaining as before, it will now return an Int? that contains the default numberOfRooms value of 1:\n\n",

      "heading": "Defining Model Classes for Optional Chaining",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "You can use optional chaining with calls to properties, methods, and subscripts that are more than one level deep. This enables you to drill down into subproperties within complex models of interrelated types, and to check whether it’s possible to access properties, methods, and subscripts on those subproperties.\n\nThe code snippets below define four model classes for use in several subsequent examples, including examples of multilevel optional chaining. These classes expand upon the Person and Residence model from above by adding a Room and Address class, with associated properties, methods, and subscripts.\n\nThe Person class is defined in the same way as before:\n\nThe Residence class is more complex than before. This time, the Residence class defines a variable property called rooms, which is initialized with an empty array of type [Room]:\n\nBecause this version of Residence stores an array of Room instances, its numberOfRooms property is implemented as a computed property, not a stored property. The computed numberOfRooms property simply returns the value of the count property from the rooms array.\n\nAs a shortcut to accessing its rooms array, this version of Residence provides a read-write subscript that provides access to the room at the requested index in the rooms array.\n\nThis version of Residence also provides a method called printNumberOfRooms, which simply prints the number of rooms in the residence.\n\nFinally, Residence defines an optional property called address, with a type of Address?. The Address class type for this property is defined below.\n\nThe Room class used for the rooms array is a simple class with one property called name, and an initializer to set that property to a suitable room name:\n\nThe final class in this model is called Address. This class has three optional properties of type String?. The first two properties, buildingName and buildingNumber, are alternative ways to identify a particular building as part of an address. The third property, street, is used to name the street for that address:\n\nThe Address class also provides a method called buildingIdentifier(), which has a return type of String?. This method checks the properties of the address and returns buildingName if it has a value, or buildingNumber concatenated with street if both have values, or nil otherwise.\n\n",

You can do this even if that method doesn’t define a return value.\n\nThe printNumberOfRooms() method on the Residence class prints the current value of numberOfRooms. Here’s how the method looks:\n\nThis method doesn’t specify a return type. However, functions and methods with no return type have an implicit return type of Void, as described in Functions Without Return Values. This means that they return a value of (), or an empty tuple.\n\nIf you call this method on an optional value with optional chaining, the method’s return type will be Void?, not Void, because return values are always of an optional type when called through optional chaining. This enables you to use an if statement to check whether it was possible to call the printNumberOfRooms() method, even though the method doesn’t itself define a return value. Compare the return value from the printNumberOfRooms call against nil to see if the method call was successful:\n\nThe same is true if you attempt to set a property through optional chaining. The example above in Accessing Properties Through Optional Chaining attempts to set an address value for john.residence, even though the residence property is nil. Any attempt to set a property through optional chaining returns a value of type Void?, which enables you to compare against nil to see if the property was set successfully:\n\n",

The optional chaining question mark always follows immediately after the part of the expression that’s optional.\n\nThe example below tries to retrieve the name of the first room in the rooms array of the john.residence property using the subscript defined on the Residence class.
