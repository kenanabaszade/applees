      "content": "Initializers can call other initializers to perform part of an instance’s initialization. This process, known as initializer delegation, avoids duplicating code across multiple initializers.\n\nThe rules for how initializer delegation works, and for what forms of delegation are allowed, are different for value types and class types. Value types (structures and enumerations) don’t support inheritance, and so their initializer delegation process is relatively simple, because they can only delegate to another initializer that they provide themselves. Classes, however, can inherit from other classes, as described in Inheritance. This means that classes have additional responsibilities for ensuring that all stored properties they inherit are assigned a suitable value during initialization. These responsibilities are described in Class Inheritance and Initialization below.\n\nFor value types, you use self.init to refer to other initializers from the same value type when writing your own custom initializers. You can call self.init only from within an initializer.\n\nNote that if you define a custom initializer for a value type, you will no longer have access to the default initializer (or the memberwise initializer, if it’s a structure) for that type. This constraint prevents a situation in which additional essential setup provided in a more complex initializer is accidentally circumvented by someone using one of the automatic initializers.\n\nNote\n\nIf you want your custom value type to be initializable with the default initializer and memberwise initializer, and also with your own custom initializers, write your custom initializers in an extension rather than as part of the value type’s original implementation. For more information, see Extensions.\n\nThe following example defines a custom Rect structure to represent a geometric rectangle. The example requires two supporting structures called Size and Point, both of which provide default values of 0.0 for all of their properties:\n\nYou can initialize the Rect structure below in one of three ways — by using its default zero-initialized origin and size property values, by providing a specific origin point and size, or by providing a specific center point and size. These initialization options are represented by three custom initializers that are part of the Rect structure’s definition:\n\nThe first Rect initializer, init(), is functionally the same as the default initializer that the structure would have received if it didn’t have its own custom initializers. This initializer has an empty body, represented by an empty pair of curly braces {}. Calling this initializer returns a Rect instance whose origin and size properties are both initialized with the default values of Point(x: 0.0, y: 0.0) and Size(width: 0.0, height: 0.0) from their property definitions:\n\nThe second Rect initializer, init(origin:size:), is functionally the same as the memberwise initializer that the structure would have received if it didn’t have its own custom initializers. This initializer simply assigns the origin and size argument values to the appropriate stored properties:\n\nThe third Rect initializer, init(center:size:), is slightly more complex. It starts by calculating an appropriate origin point based on a center point and a size value. It then calls (or delegates) to the init(origin:size:) initializer, which stores the new origin and size values in the appropriate properties:\n\nThe init(center:size:) initializer could have assigned the new values of origin and size to the appropriate properties itself. However, it’s more convenient (and clearer in intent) for the init(center:size:) initializer to take advantage of an existing initializer that already provides exactly that functionality.\n\nNote\n\nFor an alternative way to write this example without defining the init() and init(origin:size:) initializers yourself, see Extensions.\n\n",

One convenience initializer calls another convenience initializer, which in turn calls the single designated initializer. This satisfies rules 2 and 3 from above. The superclass doesn’t itself have a further superclass, and so rule 1 doesn’t apply.\n\nThe subclass in this figure has two designated initializers and one convenience initializer. The convenience initializer must call one of the two designated initializers, because it can only call another initializer from the same class. This satisfies rules 2 and 3 from above. Both designated initializers must call the single designated initializer from the superclass, to satisfy rule 1 from above.\n\nNote\n\nThese rules don’t affect how users of your classes create instances of each class. Any initializer in the diagram above can be used to create a fully initialized instance of the class they belong to. The rules only affect how you write the implementation of the class’s initializers.\n\nThe figure below shows a more complex class hierarchy for four classes.

      "heading": "Two-Phase Initialization",
      "level": 3,
      "content": "Class initialization in Swift is a two-phase process. In the first phase, each stored property is assigned an initial value by the class that introduced it. Once the initial state for every stored property has been determined, the second phase begins, and each class is given the opportunity to customize its stored properties further before the new instance is considered ready for use.\n\nThe use of a two-phase initialization process makes initialization safe, while still giving complete flexibility to each class in a class hierarchy. Two-phase initialization prevents property values from being accessed before they’re initialized, and prevents property values from being set to a different value by another initializer unexpectedly.\n\nNote\n\nSwift’s two-phase initialization process is similar to initialization in Objective-C. The main difference is that during phase 1, Objective-C assigns zero or null values (such as 0 or nil) to every property. Swift’s initialization flow is more flexible in that it lets you set custom initial values, and can cope with types for which 0 or nil isn’t a valid default value.\n\nSwift’s compiler performs four helpful safety-checks to make sure that two-phase initialization is completed without error:\n\nA designated initializer must ensure that all of the properties introduced by its class are initialized before it delegates up to a superclass initializer.\n\nAs mentioned above, the memory for an object is only considered fully initialized once the initial state of all of its stored properties is known. In order for this rule to be satisfied, a designated initializer must make sure that all of its own properties are initialized before it hands off up the chain.\n\nA designated initializer must delegate up to a superclass initializer before assigning a value to an inherited property. If it doesn’t, the new value the designated initializer assigns will be overwritten by the superclass as part of its own initialization.\n\nA convenience initializer must delegate to another initializer before assigning a value to any property (including properties defined by the same class). If it doesn’t, the new value the convenience initializer assigns will be overwritten by its own class’s designated initializer.\n\nAn initializer can’t call any instance methods, read the values of any instance properties, or refer to self as a value until after the first phase of initialization is complete.\n\nThe class instance isn’t fully valid until the first phase ends. Properties can only be accessed, and methods can only be called, once the class instance is known to be valid at the end of the first phase.\n\nHere’s how two-phase initialization plays out, based on the four safety checks above:\n\nPhase 1\n\nA designated or convenience initializer is called on a class.\n\nMemory for a new instance of that class is allocated. The memory isn’t yet initialized.\n\nA designated initializer for that class confirms that all stored properties introduced by that class have a value. The memory for these stored properties is now initialized.\n\nThe designated initializer hands off to a superclass initializer to perform the same task for its own stored properties.\n\nThis continues up the class inheritance chain until the top of the chain is reached.\n\nOnce the top of the chain is reached, and the final class in the chain has ensured that all of its stored properties have a value, the instance’s memory is considered to be fully initialized, and phase 1 is complete.\n\nPhase 2\n\nWorking back down from the top of the chain, each designated initializer in the chain has the option to customize the instance further. Initializers are now able to access self and can modify its properties, call its instance methods, and so on.\n\nFinally, any convenience initializers in the chain have the option to customize the instance and to work with self.\n\nHere’s how phase 1 looks for an initialization call for a hypothetical subclass and superclass:\n\nIn this example, initialization begins with a call to a convenience initializer on the subclass. This convenience initializer can’t yet modify any properties. It delegates across to a designated initializer from the same class.\n\nThe designated initializer makes sure that all of the subclass’s properties have a value, as per safety check 1. It then calls a designated initializer on its superclass to continue the initialization up the chain.\n\nThe superclass’s designated initializer makes sure that all of the superclass properties have a value. There are no further superclasses to initialize, and so no further delegation is needed.\n\nAs soon as all properties of the superclass have an initial value, its memory is considered fully initialized, and phase 1 is complete.\n\nHere’s how phase 2 looks for the same initialization call:\n\nThe superclass’s designated initializer now has an opportunity to customize the instance further (although it doesn’t have to).\n\nOnce the superclass’s designated initializer is finished, the subclass’s designated initializer can perform additional customization (although again, it doesn’t have to).\n\nFinally, once the subclass’s designated initializer is finished, the convenience initializer that was originally called can perform additional customization.\n\n",

      "content": "Unlike subclasses in Objective-C, Swift subclasses don’t inherit their superclass initializers by default. Swift’s approach prevents a situation in which a simple initializer from a superclass is inherited by a more specialized subclass and is used to create a new instance of the subclass that isn’t fully or correctly initialized.\n\nNote\n\nSuperclass initializers are inherited in certain circumstances, but only when it’s safe and appropriate to do so. For more information, see Automatic Initializer Inheritance below.\n\nIf you want a custom subclass to present one or more of the same initializers as its superclass, you can provide a custom implementation of those initializers within the subclass.\n\nWhen you write a subclass initializer that matches a superclass designated initializer, you are effectively providing an override of that designated initializer. Therefore, you must write the override modifier before the subclass’s initializer definition. This is true even if you are overriding an automatically provided default initializer, as described in Default Initializers.\n\nAs with an overridden property, method or subscript, the presence of the override modifier prompts Swift to check that the superclass has a matching designated initializer to be overridden, and validates that the parameters for your overriding initializer have been specified as intended.\n\nNote\n\nYou always write the override modifier when overriding a superclass designated initializer, even if your subclass’s implementation of the initializer is a convenience initializer.\n\nConversely, if you write a subclass initializer that matches a superclass convenience initializer, that superclass convenience initializer can never be called directly by your subclass, as per the rules described above in Initializer Delegation for Class Types. Therefore, your subclass is not (strictly speaking) providing an override of the superclass initializer. As a result, you don’t write the override modifier when providing a matching implementation of a superclass convenience initializer.\n\nThe example below defines a base class called Vehicle. This base class declares a stored property called numberOfWheels, with a default Int value of 0. The numberOfWheels property is used by a computed property called description to create a String description of the vehicle’s characteristics:\n\nThe Vehicle class provides a default value for its only stored property, and doesn’t provide any custom initializers itself. As a result, it automatically receives a default initializer, as described in Default Initializers. The default initializer (when available) is always a designated initializer for a class, and can be used to create a new Vehicle instance with a numberOfWheels of 0:\n\nThe next example defines a subclass of Vehicle called Bicycle:\n\nThe Bicycle subclass defines a custom designated initializer, init(). This designated initializer matches a designated initializer from the superclass of Bicycle, and so the Bicycle version of this initializer is marked with the override modifier.\n\nThe init() initializer for Bicycle starts by calling super.init(), which calls the default initializer for the Bicycle class’s superclass, Vehicle. This ensures that the numberOfWheels inherited property is initialized by Vehicle before Bicycle has the opportunity to modify the property. After calling super.init(), the original value of numberOfWheels is replaced with a new value of 2.\n\nIf you create an instance of Bicycle, you can call its inherited description computed property to see how its numberOfWheels property has been updated:\n\nIf a subclass initializer performs no customization in phase 2 of the initialization process, and the superclass has a synchronous, zero-argument designated initializer, you can omit a call to super.init() after assigning values to all of the subclass’s stored properties. If the superclass’s initializer is asynchronous, you need to write await super.init() explicitly.\n\nThis example defines another subclass of Vehicle, called Hoverboard. In its initializer, the Hoverboard class sets only its color property. Instead of making an explicit call to super.init(), this initializer relies on an implicit call to its superclass’s initializer to complete the process.\n\nAn instance of Hoverboard uses the default number of wheels supplied by the Vehicle initializer.\n\nNote\n\nSubclasses can modify inherited variable properties during initialization, but can’t modify inherited constant properties.\n\n",

      "content": "The following example shows designated initializers, convenience initializers, and automatic initializer inheritance in action. This example defines a hierarchy of three classes called Food, RecipeIngredient, and ShoppingListItem, and demonstrates how their initializers interact.\n\nThe base class in the hierarchy is called Food, which is a simple class to encapsulate the name of a foodstuff. The Food class introduces a single String property called name and provides two initializers for creating Food instances:\n\nThe figure below shows the initializer chain for the Food class:\n\nClasses don’t have a default memberwise initializer, and so the Food class provides a designated initializer that takes a single argument called name. This initializer can be used to create a new Food instance with a specific name:\n\nThe init(name: String) initializer from the Food class is provided as a designated initializer, because it ensures that all stored properties of a new Food instance are fully initialized. The Food class doesn’t have a superclass, and so the init(name: String) initializer doesn’t need to call super.init() to complete its initialization.\n\nThe Food class also provides a convenience initializer, init(), with no arguments. The init() initializer provides a default placeholder name for a new food by delegating across to the Food class’s init(name: String) with a name value of [Unnamed]:\n\nThe second class in the hierarchy is a subclass of Food called RecipeIngredient. The RecipeIngredient class models an ingredient in a cooking recipe. It introduces an Int property called quantity (in addition to the name property it inherits from Food) and defines two initializers for creating RecipeIngredient instances:\n\nThe figure below shows the initializer chain for the RecipeIngredient class:\n\nThe RecipeIngredient class has a single designated initializer, init(name: String, quantity: Int), which can be used to populate all of the properties of a new RecipeIngredient instance. This initializer starts by assigning the passed quantity argument to the quantity property, which is the only new property introduced by RecipeIngredient. After doing so, the initializer delegates up to the init(name: String) initializer of the Food class. This process satisfies safety check 1 from Two-Phase Initialization above.\n\nRecipeIngredient also defines a convenience initializer, init(name: String), which is used to create a RecipeIngredient instance by name alone. This convenience initializer assumes a quantity of 1 for any RecipeIngredient instance that’s created without an explicit quantity. The definition of this convenience initializer makes RecipeIngredient instances quicker and more convenient to create, and avoids code duplication when creating several single-quantity RecipeIngredient instances. This convenience initializer simply delegates across to the class’s designated initializer, passing in a quantity value of 1.\n\nThe init(name: String) convenience initializer provided by RecipeIngredient takes the same parameters as the init(name: String) designated initializer from Food. Because this convenience initializer overrides a designated initializer from its superclass, it must be marked with the override modifier (as described in Initializer Inheritance and Overriding).\n\nEven though RecipeIngredient provides the init(name: String) initializer as a convenience initializer, RecipeIngredient has nonetheless provided an implementation of all of its superclass’s designated initializers. Therefore, RecipeIngredient automatically inherits all of its superclass’s convenience initializers too.\n\nIn this example, the superclass for RecipeIngredient is Food, which has a single convenience initializer called init(). This initializer is therefore inherited by RecipeIngredient. The inherited version of init() functions in exactly the same way as the Food version, except that it delegates to the RecipeIngredient version of init(name: String) rather than the Food version.\n\nAll three of these initializers can be used to create new RecipeIngredient instances:\n\nThe third and final class in the hierarchy is a subclass of RecipeIngredient called ShoppingListItem. The ShoppingListItem class models a recipe ingredient as it appears in a shopping list.\n\nEvery item in the shopping list starts out as “unpurchased”. To represent this fact, ShoppingListItem introduces a Boolean property called purchased, with a default value of false. ShoppingListItem also adds a computed description property, which provides a textual description of a ShoppingListItem instance:\n\nNote\n\nShoppingListItem doesn’t define an initializer to provide an initial value for purchased, because items in a shopping list (as modeled here) always start out unpurchased.\n\nBecause it provides a default value for all of the properties it introduces and doesn’t define any initializers itself, ShoppingListItem automatically inherits all of the designated and convenience initializers from its superclass.\n\nThe figure below shows the overall initializer chain for all three classes:\n\nYou can use all three of the inherited initializers to create a new ShoppingListItem instance:\n\nHere, a new array called breakfastList is created from an array literal containing three new ShoppingListItem instances. The type of the array is inferred to be [ShoppingListItem]. After the array is created, the name of the ShoppingListItem at the start of the array is changed from \"[Unnamed]\" to \"Orange juice\" and it’s marked as having been purchased. Printing the description of each item in the array shows that their default states have been set as expected.\n\n",

      "content": "It’s sometimes useful to define a class, structure, or enumeration for which initialization can fail. This failure might be triggered by invalid initialization parameter values, the absence of a required external resource, or some other condition that prevents initialization from succeeding.\n\nTo cope with initialization conditions that can fail, define one or more failable initializers as part of a class, structure, or enumeration definition. You write a failable initializer by placing a question mark after the init keyword (init?).\n\nNote\n\nYou can’t define a failable and a nonfailable initializer with the same parameter types and names.\n\nA failable initializer creates an optional value of the type it initializes. You write return nil within a failable initializer to indicate a point at which initialization failure can be triggered.\n\nNote\n\nStrictly speaking, initializers don’t return a value. Rather, their role is to ensure that self is fully and correctly initialized by the time that initialization ends. Although you write return nil to trigger an initialization failure, you don’t use the return keyword to indicate initialization success.\n\nFor instance, failable initializers are implemented for numeric type conversions. To ensure conversion between numeric types maintains the value exactly, use the init(exactly:) initializer. If the type conversion can’t maintain the value, the initializer fails.\n\nThe example below defines a structure called Animal, with a constant String property called species. The Animal structure also defines a failable initializer with a single parameter called species. This initializer checks if the species value passed to the initializer is an empty string.

Otherwise, the species property’s value is set, and initialization succeeds:\n\nYou can use this failable initializer to try to initialize a new Animal instance and to check if initialization succeeded:\n\nIf you pass an empty string value to the failable initializer’s species parameter, the initializer triggers an initialization failure:\n\nNote\n\nChecking for an empty string value (such as \"\" rather than \"Giraffe\") isn’t the same as checking for nil to indicate the absence of an optional String value. In the example above, an empty string (\"\") is a valid, non-optional String. However, it’s not appropriate for an animal to have an empty string as the value of its species property.

Alternatively, you can define a failable initializer that creates an implicitly unwrapped optional instance of the appropriate type. Do this by placing an exclamation point after the init keyword (init!) instead of a question mark.\n\nYou can delegate from init? to init! and vice versa, and you can override init? with init! and vice versa. You can also delegate from init to init!, although doing so will trigger an assertion if the init! initializer causes initialization to fail.\n\n",

      "level": 2,
      "content": "If a stored property’s default value requires some customization or setup, you can use a closure or global function to provide a customized default value for that property. Whenever a new instance of the type that the property belongs to is initialized, the closure or function is called, and its return value is assigned as the property’s default value.\n\nThese kinds of closures or functions typically create a temporary value of the same type as the property, tailor that value to represent the desired initial state, and then return that temporary value to be used as the property’s default value.\n\nHere’s a skeleton outline of how a closure can be used to provide a default property value:\n\nNote that the closure’s end curly brace is followed by an empty pair of parentheses. This tells Swift to execute the closure immediately. If you omit these parentheses, you are trying to assign the closure itself to the property, and not the return value of the closure.\n\nNote\n\nIf you use a closure to initialize a property, remember that the rest of the instance hasn’t yet been initialized at the point that the closure is executed. This means that you can’t access any other property values from within your closure, even if those properties have default values. You also can’t use the implicit self property, or call any of the instance’s methods.\n\nThe example below defines a structure called Chessboard, which models a board for the game of chess. Chess is played on an 8 x 8 board, with alternating black and white squares.\n\nTo represent this game board, the Chessboard structure has a single property called boardColors, which is an array of 64 Bool values. A value of true in the array represents a black square and a value of false represents a white square. The first item in the array represents the top left square on the board and the last item in the array represents the bottom right square on the board.\n\nThe boardColors array is initialized with a closure to set up its color values:\n\nWhenever a new Chessboard instance is created, the closure is executed, and the default value of boardColors is calculated and returned. The closure in the example above calculates and sets the appropriate color for each square on the board in a temporary array called temporaryBoard, and returns this temporary array as the closure’s return value once its setup is complete. The returned array value is stored in boardColors and can be queried with the squareIsBlackAt(row:column:) utility function:\n\n",
