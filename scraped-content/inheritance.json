Classes you define without specifying a superclass automatically become base classes for you to build upon.\n\nThe example below defines a base class called Vehicle. This base class defines a stored property called currentSpeed, with a default value of 0.0 (inferring a property type of Double). The currentSpeed property’s value is used by a read-only computed String property called description to create a description of the vehicle.\n\nThe Vehicle base class also defines a method called makeNoise. This method doesn’t actually do anything for a base Vehicle instance, but will be customized by subclasses of Vehicle later on:\n\nYou create a new instance of Vehicle with initializer syntax, which is written as a type name followed by empty parentheses:\n\nHaving created a new Vehicle instance, you can access its description property to print a human-readable description of the vehicle’s current speed:\n\nThe Vehicle class defines common characteristics for an arbitrary vehicle, but isn’t much use in itself. To make it more useful, you need to refine it to describe more specific kinds of vehicles.\n\n",

      "content": "Subclassing is the act of basing a new class on an existing class. The subclass inherits characteristics from the existing class, which you can then refine. You can also add new characteristics to the subclass.\n\nTo indicate that a subclass has a superclass, write the subclass name before the superclass name, separated by a colon:\n\nThe following example defines a subclass called Bicycle, with a superclass of Vehicle:\n\nThe new Bicycle class automatically gains all of the characteristics of Vehicle, such as its currentSpeed and description properties and its makeNoise() method.\n\nIn addition to the characteristics it inherits, the Bicycle class defines a new stored property, hasBasket, with a default value of false (inferring a type of Bool for the property).\n\nBy default, any new Bicycle instance you create will not have a basket. You can set the hasBasket property to true for a particular Bicycle instance after that instance is created:\n\nYou can also modify the inherited currentSpeed property of a Bicycle instance, and query the instance’s inherited description property:\n\nSubclasses can themselves be subclassed. The next example creates a subclass of Bicycle for a two-seater bicycle known as a “tandem”:\n\nTandem inherits all of the properties and methods from Bicycle, which in turn inherits all of the properties and methods from Vehicle. The Tandem subclass also adds a new stored property called currentNumberOfPassengers, with a default value of 0.\n\nIf you create an instance of Tandem, you can work with any of its new and inherited properties, and query the read-only description property it inherits from Vehicle:\n\n",

This is known as overriding.\n\nTo override a characteristic that would otherwise be inherited, you prefix your overriding definition with the override keyword. Doing so clarifies that you intend to provide an override and haven’t provided a matching definition by mistake. Overriding by accident can cause unexpected behavior, and any overrides without the override keyword are diagnosed as an error when your code is compiled.\n\nThe override keyword also prompts the Swift compiler to check that your overriding class’s superclass (or one of its parents) has a declaration that matches the one you provided for the override. This check ensures that your overriding definition is correct.\n\n",

The stored or computed nature of an inherited property isn’t known by a subclass — it only knows that the inherited property has a certain name and type. You must always state both the name and the type of the property you are overriding, to enable the compiler to check that your override matches a superclass property with the same name and type.\n\nYou can present an inherited read-only property as a read-write property by providing both a getter and a setter in your subclass property override. You can’t, however, present an inherited read-write property as a read-only property.\n\nNote\n\nIf you provide a setter as part of a property override, you must also provide a getter for that override. If you don’t want to modify the inherited property’s value within the overriding getter, you can simply pass through the inherited value by returning super.someProperty from the getter, where someProperty is the name of the property you are overriding.\n\nThe following example defines a new class called Car, which is a subclass of Vehicle. The Car class introduces a new stored property called gear, with a default integer value of 1. The Car class also overrides the description property it inherits from Vehicle, to provide a custom description that includes the current gear:\n\nThe override of the description property starts by calling super.description, which returns the Vehicle class’s description property. The Car class’s version of description then adds some extra text onto the end of this description to provide information about the current gear.\n\nIf you create an instance of the Car class and set its gear and currentSpeed properties, you can see that its description property returns the tailored description defined within the Car class:\n\n",

This enables you to be notified when the value of an inherited property changes, regardless of how that property was originally implemented. For more information on property observers, see Property Observers.\n\nNote\n\nYou can’t add property observers to inherited constant stored properties or inherited read-only computed properties. The value of these properties can’t be set, and so it isn’t appropriate to provide a willSet or didSet implementation as part of an override.\n\nNote also that you can’t provide both an overriding setter and an overriding property observer for the same property. If you want to observe changes to a property’s value, and you are already providing a custom setter for that property, you can simply observe any value changes from within the custom setter.\n\nThe following example defines a new class called AutomaticCar, which is a subclass of Car. The AutomaticCar class represents a car with an automatic gearbox, which automatically selects an appropriate gear to use based on the current speed:\n\nWhenever you set the currentSpeed property of an AutomaticCar instance, the property’s didSet observer sets the instance’s gear property to an appropriate choice of gear for the new speed. Specifically, the property observer chooses a gear that’s the new currentSpeed value divided by 10, rounded down to the nearest integer, plus 1. A speed of 35.0 produces a gear of 4:\n\n",
