      "content": "Constants and variables must be declared before they’re used. You declare constants with the let keyword and variables with the var keyword. Here’s an example of how constants and variables can be used to track the number of login attempts a user has made:\n\nThis code can be read as:\n\n“Declare a new constant called maximumNumberOfLoginAttempts, and give it a value of 10. Then, declare a new variable called currentLoginAttempt, and give it an initial value of 0.”\n\nIn this example, the maximum number of allowed login attempts is declared as a constant, because the maximum value never changes. The current login attempt counter is declared as a variable, because this value must be incremented after each failed login attempt.\n\nIf a stored value in your code won’t change, always declare it as a constant with the let keyword. Use variables only for storing values that change.\n\nWhen you declare a constant or a variable, you can give it a value as part of that declaration, like the examples above. Alternatively, you can assign its initial value later in the program, as long as it’s guaranteed to have a value before the first time you read from it.\n\nIn this example, the maximum number of login attempts is constant, and its value depends on the environment. In the development environment, it has a value of 100; in any other environment, its value is 10. Both branches of the if statement initialize maximumNumberOfLoginAttempts with some value, guaranteeing that the constant always gets a value. For information about how Swift checks your code when you set an initial value this way, see Constant Declaration.\n\nYou can declare multiple constants or multiple variables on a single line, separated by commas:\n\n",

Write a type annotation by placing a colon after the constant or variable name, followed by a space, followed by the name of the type to use.\n\nThis example provides a type annotation for a variable called welcomeMessage, to indicate that the variable can store String values:\n\nThe colon in the declaration means “…of type…,” so the code above can be read as:\n\n“Declare a variable called welcomeMessage that’s of type String.”\n\nThe phrase “of type String” means “can store any String value.” Think of it as meaning “the type of thing” (or “the kind of thing”) that can be stored.\n\nThe welcomeMessage variable can now be set to any string value without error:\n\nYou can define multiple related variables of the same type on a single line, separated by commas, with a single type annotation after the final variable name:\n\nNote\n\nIt’s rare that you need to write type annotations in practice. If you provide an initial value for a constant or variable at the point that it’s defined, Swift can almost always infer the type to be used for that constant or variable, as described in Type Safety and Type Inference. In the welcomeMessage example above, no initial value is provided, and so the type of the welcomeMessage variable is specified with a type annotation rather than being inferred from an initial value.\n\n",

Integers are either signed (positive, zero, or negative) or unsigned (positive or zero), and their maximum and minimum value depends on their size (the number of bits used to store values). The integer types include their size and sign in their names — for example, an 8-bit unsigned integer is of type UInt8, and a 32-bit signed integer is of type Int32. Like all types in Swift, these integer types have capitalized names. In most cases, when you don’t need to specify the exact integer size, you use the Int type described below.\n\nInteger types behave like most arithmetic you do by hand; integer math produces results without approximating. These characteristics make integers suitable for counting and other calculations that represent exact amounts — for example, finding the longest line in a text file, applying a score multiplier in a game, or totaling prices on a receipt.\n\nAlthough integers don’t have a fractional component, you can use integers to represent quantities with fractions by counting a fractional part. For example, you can represent $1.23 by storing the number 123 in an integer that counts cents. This approach is known as fixed-point math because the decimal point is at a fixed position in the number. In the example above, the number 123 is understood to have a decimal point before the last two digits.\n\nNote\n\nFor calculations in a regulated area like finance or construction, or in a domain that has an expectation of high-precision results, you might need a special-purpose numeric type that implements behaviors such as rounding and truncation, according to that area’s requirements.\n\n",

This aids code consistency and interoperability. Even on 32-bit platforms, Int can store any value between -2,147,483,648 and 2,147,483,647, and is large enough for many integer ranges.\n\n",

      "content": "Floating-point numbers have a fractional component, such as 3.14159, 0.1, and -273.15. Swift provides a variety of floating-point types that support different sizes of numbers, just like it has different sizes of integers. If you don’t need to specify an exact size, use Double. Otherwise, use the type that includes the needed size in its name, such as Float16 or Float80. Following common terminology for floating-point math, Float uses 32 bits and Double uses 64 bits. You can also write these types as Float32 or Float64. For example, graphics code often uses Float to match the GPU’s fastest data type. Some floating-point types are supported only by certain platforms, but Float and Double are available on all platforms.\n\nFloating-point numbers let you work with very small and very large numbers, but can’t represent every possible value in that range. Unlike integer calculations, which always produce an exact result, floating-point math rounds results to the nearest representable number. For example, when storing the number 10,000 as a Float, the next largest number you can represent is 10,000.001 –– values between these two numbers round to one or the other. The space between numbers is also variable; there are larger spaces between large numbers than between small numbers. For example, the next Float value after 0.001 is 0.0010000002, which is smaller than the spacing after 10,000.\n\nFloating-point numbers have values for negative zero, infinity, and negative infinity, which represent overflow and underflow in calculations. They also have include not-a-number (NaN) values to represent an invalid or undefined result, such as dividing zero by zero. This behavior is different from integers, which stop the program if they can’t represent the result.\n\nIf you need the same spacing between all possible values, or if the calculations you’re doing require exact results and don’t call for the special values listed above, a floating-point number might not be the right data type. Consider using fixed-point numbers instead, as described in Integers.\n\n",

      "heading": "Type Safety and Type Inference",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "Every value in a Swift program has a type. Every place you store a value — including constants, variables, and properties — also has a type. You might write the type explicitly using a type annotation, or Swift might infer the type from an initial value. Every place in your code where you provide a value, that value’s type must match the place you use it. For example, if part of your code requires a String, you can’t pass it an Int by mistake. This kind of checking makes Swift a type-safe language.\n\nA type safe language encourages you to be clear about the types of values your code works with. Values of one type are never implicitly converted to another type. However, some types can be explicitly converted. When building code, Swift checks the code for type safety and flags any mismatched types as errors.\n\nType checking helps you avoid errors when you’re working with different types of values. However, this doesn’t mean that you have to specify the type of every constant and variable that you declare. If you don’t specify the type of value you need, Swift uses type inference to work out the appropriate type. Type inference enables a compiler to deduce the type of a particular expression automatically when it compiles your code, simply by examining the values you provide.\n\nBecause of type inference, Swift requires far fewer type declarations than languages such as C or Objective-C. Constants and variables are still explicitly typed, but much of the work of specifying their type is done for you.\n\nType inference is particularly useful when you declare a constant or variable with an initial value. This is often done by assigning a literal value (or literal) to the constant or variable at the point that you declare it. (A literal value is a value that appears directly in your source code, such as 42 and 3.14159 in the examples below.)\n\nFor example, if you assign a literal value of 42 to a new constant without saying what type it is, Swift infers that you want the constant to be an Int, because you have initialized it with a number that looks like an integer:\n\nLikewise, if you don’t specify a type for a floating-point literal, Swift infers that you want to create a Double:\n\nSwift always chooses Double (rather than Float) when inferring the type of floating-point numbers.\n\nIf you combine integer and floating-point literals in an expression, a type of Double will be inferred from the context:\n\nThe literal value of 3 has no explicit type in and of itself, and so an appropriate output type of Double is inferred from the presence of a floating-point literal as part of the addition.\n\n",

However, only some strings can be converted into integers. The string \"123\" can be converted into the numeric value 123, but the string \"hello, world\" doesn’t have a corresponding numeric value. The example below uses the initializer to try to convert a String into an Int:\n\nBecause the initializer in the code above might fail, it returns an optional Int, rather than an Int.\n\nTo write an optional type, you write a question mark (?) after the name of the type that the optional contains — for example, the type of an optional Int is Int?.

You perform this comparison with the “equal to” operator (==) or the “not equal to” operator (!=).\n\nIf an optional has a value, it’s considered as “not equal to” nil:\n\nYou can’t use nil with non-optional constants or variables. If a constant or variable in your code needs to work with the absence of a value under certain conditions, declare it as an optional value of the appropriate type.

You can’t accidentally treat an optional as if it were non-optional because this mistake produces an error at compile time. After you unwrap the value, none of the other code that works with that value needs to check for nil, so there’s no need to repeatedly check the same value in different parts of your code.\n\nWhen you access an optional value, your code always handles both the nil and non-nil case. There are several things you can do when a value is missing, as described in the following sections:\n\nSkip the code that operates on the value when it’s nil.\n\nPropagate the nil value, by returning nil or using the ?. operator described in Optional Chaining.\n\nProvide a fallback value, using the ?? operator.\n\nStop program execution, using the ! operator.\n\nNote\n\nIn Objective-C, nil is a pointer to a nonexistent object.

Optional binding can be used with if, guard, and while statements to check for a value inside an optional, and to extract that value into a constant or variable, as part of a single action. For more information about if, guard, and while statements, see Control Flow.\n\nWrite an optional binding for an if statement as follows:\n\nYou can rewrite the possibleNumber example from the Optionals section to use optional binding rather than forced unwrapping:\n\nThis code can be read as:\n\n“If the optional Int returned by Int(possibleNumber) contains a value, set a new constant called actualNumber to the value contained in the optional.”\n\nIf the conversion is successful, the actualNumber constant becomes available for use within the first branch of the if statement. It has already been initialized with the value contained within the optional, and has the corresponding non-optional type. In this case, the type of possibleNumber is Int?, so the type of actualNumber is Int.\n\nIf you don’t need to refer to the original, optional constant or variable after accessing the value it contains, you can use the same name for the new constant or variable:\n\nThis code starts by checking whether myNumber contains a value, just like the code in the previous example. If myNumber has a value, the value of a new constant named myNumber is set to that value. Inside the body of the if statement, writing myNumber refers to that new non-optional constant. Writing myNumber before or after the if statement refers to the original optional integer constant.\n\nBecause this kind of code is so common, you can use a shorter spelling to unwrap an optional value: Write just the name of the constant or variable that you’re unwrapping. The new, unwrapped constant or variable implicitly uses the same name as the optional value.\n\nYou can use both constants and variables with optional binding. If you wanted to manipulate the value of myNumber within the first branch of the if statement, you could write if var myNumber instead, and the value contained within the optional would be made available as a variable rather than a constant. Changes you make to myNumber inside the body of the if statement apply only to that local variable, not to the original, optional constant or variable that you unwrapped.\n\nYou can include as many optional bindings and Boolean conditions in a single if statement as you need to, separated by commas. If any of the values in the optional bindings are nil or any Boolean condition evaluates to false, the whole if statement’s condition is considered to be false. The following if statements are equivalent:\n\nConstants and variables created with optional binding in an if statement are available only within the body of the if statement.

Optionals can be checked with an if statement to see if a value exists, and can be conditionally unwrapped with optional binding to access the optional’s value if it does exist.\n\nSometimes it’s clear from a program’s structure that an optional will always have a value, after that value is first set. In these cases, it’s useful to remove the need to check and unwrap the optional’s value every time it’s accessed, because it can be safely assumed to have a value all of the time.\n\nThese kinds of optionals are defined as implicitly unwrapped optionals. You write an implicitly unwrapped optional by placing an exclamation point (String!) rather than a question mark (String?) after the type that you want to make optional. Rather than placing an exclamation point after the optional’s name when you use it, you place an exclamation point after the optional’s type when you declare it.\n\nImplicitly unwrapped optionals are useful when an optional’s value is confirmed to exist immediately after the optional is first defined and can definitely be assumed to exist at every point thereafter. The primary use of implicitly unwrapped optionals in Swift is during class initialization, as described in Unowned References and Implicitly Unwrapped Optional Properties.\n\nDon’t use an implicitly unwrapped optional when there’s a possibility of a variable becoming nil at a later point. Always use a normal optional type if you need to check for a nil value during the lifetime of a variable.\n\nAn implicitly unwrapped optional is a normal optional behind the scenes, but can also be used like a non-optional value, without the need to unwrap the optional value each time it’s accessed. The following example shows the difference in behavior between an optional string and an implicitly unwrapped optional string when accessing their wrapped value as an explicit String:\n\nYou can think of an implicitly unwrapped optional as giving permission for the optional to be force-unwrapped if needed. When you use an implicitly unwrapped optional value, Swift first tries to use it as an ordinary optional value; if it can’t be used as an optional, Swift force-unwraps the value. In the code above, the optional value assumedString is force-unwrapped before assigning its value to implicitString because implicitString has an explicit, non-optional type of String. In code below, optionalString doesn’t have an explicit type so it’s an ordinary optional.\n\nIf an implicitly unwrapped optional is nil and you try to access its wrapped value, you’ll trigger a runtime error. The result is exactly the same as if you write an exclamation point to force unwrap a normal optional that doesn’t contain a value.\n\nYou can check whether an implicitly unwrapped optional is nil the same way you check a normal optional:\n\nYou can also use an implicitly unwrapped optional with optional binding, to check and unwrap its value in a single statement:\n\n",

If you haven’t encountered these issues, that’s ok; safe code in Swift avoids these problems. For information about how Swift ensures you set initial values, see Initialization, for information about how Swift checks memory safety in concurrent code, see Concurrency, and for information about how Swift checks overlapping accesses to memory, see Memory Safety.\n\nSometimes you need to work outside of the bounds of safety — for example, because of limitations of the language or standard library — so Swift also provides unsafe versions of some APIs. When you use types or methods whose name includes words such as “unsafe”, “unchecked”, or “unmanaged”, you take on the responsibility for safety.\n\nSafe code in Swift can still encounter errors and unexpected failures, which might stop the program’s execution. Safety doesn’t ensure that your code runs to completion. Swift provides several ways to indicate and recover from errors, discussed in Error Handling and Assertions and Preconditions below. However, in some cases, the only safe way to handle an error is to stop execution.

That function’s caller can then catch the error and respond appropriately.\n\nA function indicates that it can throw an error by including the throws keyword in its declaration. When you call a function that can throw an error, you prepend the try keyword to the expression.\n\nSwift automatically propagates errors out of their current scope until they’re handled by a catch clause.\n\nA do statement creates a new containing scope, which allows errors to be propagated to one or more catch clauses.\n\nHere’s an example of how error handling can be used to respond to different error conditions:\n\nIn this example, the makeASandwich() function will throw an error if no clean dishes are available or if any ingredients are missing.

Because a failed assertion or precondition indicates an invalid program state, there’s no way to catch a failed assertion. Recovering from an invalid state is impossible. When an assertion fails, at least one piece of the program’s data is invalid — but you don’t know why it’s invalid or whether an additional state is also invalid.\n\nUsing assertions and preconditions isn’t a substitute for designing your code in such a way that invalid conditions are unlikely to arise. However, using them to enforce valid data and state causes your app to terminate more predictably if an invalid state occurs, and helps make the problem easier to debug. When assumptions aren’t checked, you might not notice this kind problem until much later when code elsewhere starts failing visibly, and after user data has been silently corrupted. Stopping execution as soon as an invalid state is detected also helps limit the damage caused by that invalid state.\n\nThe difference between assertions and preconditions is in when they’re checked: Assertions are checked only in debug builds, but preconditions are checked in both debug and production builds. In production builds, the condition inside an assertion isn’t evaluated. This means you can use as many assertions as you want during your development process, without impacting performance in production.\n\n",

For example, use a precondition to check that a subscript isn’t out of bounds, or to check that a function has been passed a valid value.\n\nYou write a precondition by calling the precondition(_:_:file:line:) function. You pass this function an expression that evaluates to true or false and a message to display if the result of the condition is false.

The compiler assumes that preconditions are always true, and it optimizes your code accordingly. However, the fatalError(_:file:line:) function always halts execution, regardless of optimization settings.\n\nYou can use the fatalError(_:file:line:) function during prototyping and early development to create stubs for functionality that hasn’t been implemented yet, by writing fatalError(\"Unimplemented\") as the stub implementation. Because fatal errors are never optimized out, unlike assertions or preconditions, you can be sure that execution always halts if it encounters a stub implementation.\n\n",
